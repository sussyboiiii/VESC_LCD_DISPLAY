# vesc_lcd
Some Arduino code for viewing stats of your VESC 6 on an I2C 4x20 LCD Screen.

You need:
- VESC 6
- Arduino
- 4x20 I2C LCD

Optional:
- Buck Boost Converter with elko parallel to input pins (for stable voltage)
- 10k at 25Â°C NTC for ambient temperature measurment
- RTC as clock


Ebike_good.py can be used in combination with my lcd_emulator to check the lcd display functions without needing an arduino or display.

If you encounter anybug please feel free to open an issue or make a pr. Thanks!
